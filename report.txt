4.1 enframe
Data.samplingrate= 20000 Hz and window length of 20 milliseconds 
So the number of signal in each window is 20kHz * 20 ms = 400
The shift is 10 ms, the number of overlap signal in one window is 20kHz * 10 ms = 200

4.2 Pre-emphasis
The lfilter function in scipy.signal:
a[0]*y[n] = b[0]*x[n] + b[1]*x[n-1] + ... + b[M]*x[n-M] - a[1]*y[n-1] - ... - a[N]*y[n-N]

And in our experiment:
y [n] = x[n] − αx[n − 1]

So the filter coefficient :
a is a array with the length of input signal, and a[0] is 1, others are 0.
b is a array with the length of input signal, and b[0] is 1, b[1] is -0.97, others are 0.

4.3 windowing


The reason why this windowing should be applied to the frames of speech signal:
1)used as one of many windowing functions for smoothing values. 
2)counteract the assumption made by the FFT that the data is infinite and to reduce spectral leakage.
